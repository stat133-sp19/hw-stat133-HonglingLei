## Workout Projects

- [Workout 1](workout1)\
This R written project is mainly about the data analysis cycle of NBA GSW data. In the data preparation stage, I downloaded data, cleaned data by manipulating them, and merged files for further analysis. In the core analysis stage, I wrote code to make statistical summaries of different players' performances, plotted graphs to display their shots and changed the formats of the graphs to enable them to be shown in the final report. In the reporting stage, I wrote an Rmd file to display the analyzing process and results to readers. My final report includes the following parts - introduction, motivation, background, data, analysis, discussion, conclusion, and references.

- [Workout 2](workout2)\
In this project, I created a Shiny App that allows users to visualize - in an interactive way - some of the saving/investing scenatios. There are three modes of investing: no contribution after principal, fixed annual contribution, and growing annual contribution. When users open this Shiny App, they can drag the dot on each bar to customize parameters, such as "Initial Amount", "Return Rate", "Years", "Annual Contribution", "Growth Rate", and whether they want a faceted display or not. Then the App automatically calculates the total account balance each year under the three investing modes. It also graphs the balances with time to give users a visual understanding of the growing trends.

- [Workout 3](workout3)\
I created an R package called "binomial" that provides functions to check whether the inputs are valid, to calculate the probability based on given parameters, to graph the distribution and to display a summary of expected value, variance, skewness, kurtosis, etc.
