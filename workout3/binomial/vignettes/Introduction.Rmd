## Binomial

The package `"binomial"` is a minimal implementation for binomial experiments. It checks whether the inputs are valid, calculates the probability based on given parameters, and graphs the distribution, displays a summary of expected value, variance, etc.


## Calculate number of combinations

Given the number of trials and aimed success, we can calculate the number of possible results. For example, we try 6 times and expect 3 success, and there will be 20 possible situations in total.
```{r}
bin_choose(n=5, k=2)
```

## Calculate the probability

Given the number of trials (n), aimed success (k) and probability of success per trial, we can calculate the probability of getting k success out of n trials. For example, given prob (each trial) = 0.5, we try 6 times and expect 3 success.
```{r}
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

## Display a table of success and probability

Given the number of trials and probability of success per trial, we can generate a table with all the possible success and corresponding overall probability. For example, suppose we have 5 trials and probability for each trial is 0.5.
```{r}
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
dis1
```

## Plot a histogram of the table derived

Introduction.Rmd

```{r}
plot(dis1)
```

## Calculate the cumulative probability

Based on the table with success and probability we get, we can calculate cumulative probability by adding up the previous probability.
```{r}
bin_cum<- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
bin_cum
```

## Plot the cumulative probability

Plot a line graph of the table derived.
```{r}
plot(bin_cum)
```

## Calculate summary measures

Suppose we try 5 times and probability per trial is 0.5:
`bin_mean()` calculates the mean of the binomial distribution.    
`bin_variance()` calculates the variance of the binomial distribution.    
`bin_mode()` calculates the mode of the binomial distribution.         
`bin_skewness()` calculates the skewness the given binomial distribution.        
`bin_kurtosis()` calculates the kurtosis the given binomial distribution.  

```{r}
bin_mean(5, 0.5)
bin_variance(5, 0.5)
bin_mode(5, 0.5)
bin_skewness(5, 0.5)
bin_kurtosis(5, 0.5)
```

## Create a binomial variable

Given number of trials and probability per trial, we can generate a binomial variable. For example, trials = 5 and prob = 0.5.
```{r}
bin_var <- bin_variable(trials=5, prob=0.5)
bin_var
```

## Obtain a summary of the binomial variable
```{r}
bin_sum <- summary(bin_var)
bin_sum
```
