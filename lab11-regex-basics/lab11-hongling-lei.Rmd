```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
getwd()
dat <- read.csv("text-emotion.csv")
```

## 1) Number of characters per tweet*
```{r}
nchar_content <- str_count(dat$content)
summary(nchar_content)
```
```{r}
hist(nchar_content, main = "Histogram of number of characters", breaks = seq(0,200,5))
```
```{r}
# Are there any tweets with 0 characters?
sum(nchar_content == 0)
```
So there is no tweet with 0 character.
```{r}
# Are there any tweets with 1 character? If yes (write commands that answer these questions):
# how many?
sum(nchar_content == 1)
# what is their content?
dat$content[nchar_content == 1]
# what is their location (i.e. index or position)?
which(nchar_content == 1)
```

```{r}
# What is the tweet with the most characters (i.e. max length)? 
# (write a command that answers these questions).
# the number of characters
max(nchar_content)
# display its content
dat$content[nchar_content == max(nchar_content)]
# what is its location (i.e. index or position)?
which(nchar_content == max(nchar_content))
```

## 2) Author (usernames)*
```{r}
nchar_user = str_count(dat$author)
# No longer than 15 characters (if you find usernames longer than 15 characters, display them)
sum(nchar_user > 15)
# Contain alphanumeric characters and underscore
sum(str_detect(dat$author, pattern = "\\W"))
# If you find usernames containing other symbols, display them. 
dat$author[str_detect(dat$author, pattern = "\\W")== 1]
# What is the number of characters of the shortest usernames?
min(nchar_user)
```

## 3) Various Symbols and Strings*
```{r}
# How many tweets contain at least one caret symbol "^"
sum(str_detect(dat$content, pattern = "[\\^]{1,}")) # {1,} means more than 1
# How many tweets contain three or more consecutive dollar symbols "$"
sum(str_detect(dat$content, pattern = "[\\$]{3,}"))
# How many tweets do NOT contain the characters "a" or "A"
sum(!(str_detect(dat$content, fixed('a',ignore_case = TRUE))))
# Display the first 10 elements of the tweets that do NOT contain the characters "a" or "A"
head(dat$content[(str_detect(dat$content, fixed('a',ignore_case = TRUE))) == FALSE], 10)
# compute a vector with the number of exclamation symbols in each tweet, and display its summary().
num_exc <- str_count(dat$content, pattern = "[\\!]")
summary(num_exc)
# Whatâ€™s the tweet (content) with the largest number of exclamation symbols !? Display its content.
dat$content[num_exc == max(num_exc)]
```

## 4) Sentiment*
```{r}
# What are the different types of sentiments (i.e. categories)?
# compute the frequencies
sent <- table(dat$sentiment)/40000
sent
# Graph the relative frequencies (i.e. proportions) with a horizontal barplot in decreasing order
barplot(sort(sent, decreasing = FALSE), horiz = TRUE, las = 1) # las = 1 means let the name of each sentiment be horizontal
# compute a table with the average length of characters per sentiment 
dat2 <- mutate(dat, length = str_count(dat$content))
summarise(group_by(dat2, sentiment), 
          avg = mean(length))
```
