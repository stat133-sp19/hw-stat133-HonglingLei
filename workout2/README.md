Project Description
--------

In this project, I created a Shiny App that allows users to visualize - in an interactive way - some of the saving/investing scenatios. There are three modes of investing: no contribution after principal, fixed annual contribution, and growing annual contribution. When users open this Shiny App, they can drag the dot on each bar to customize parameters, such as "Initial Amount", "Return Rate", "Years", "Annual Contribution", "Growth Rate", and whether they want a faceted display or not. Then the App automatically calculates the total account balance each year under the three investing modes. It also graphs the balances with time to give users a visual understanding of the growing trends.
